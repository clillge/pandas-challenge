Pandas Challenge HW - Module 4

Coding Notes:
 - Took longer than previous assingments due to personal time constraints but an enjoyable challenge nonetheless

 - Ran into some issues with grabbing all the school types, unsure if the method was the best used.
    - Utilized the apply function with the help of some pandas .apply documentation research as previous output without the function returned an ndarray that wasn't able to be used in the last activity.

 - Had some issues creating Dataframes all at once. Ended up creating an empty Dataframe and appending it. Removed prior issues but added a lot of redundant code. Will look towards solutions in the future.

 - Few issues with later code, any issues mostly derived from prior code. Did appreciate the consistent code checks that require an appropriate output before continuing. Allowed me to check myself along the way before getting too far.
